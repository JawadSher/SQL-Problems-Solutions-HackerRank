## Problem Solution
```sql
SELECT * FROM CITY 
WHERE POPULATION>100000 AND COUNTRYCODE='USA'
```

## Problem Solution Explanation

Letâ€™s break down the SQL query line by line:

1. **`SELECT *`**:
   - **Purpose**: This part of the query specifies what data you want to retrieve.
   - **Details**: The `SELECT` keyword is used to choose columns from a table. The `*` symbol is a wildcard that means "all columns". So, `SELECT *` means "retrieve all columns from the table."

2. **`FROM CITY`**:
   - **Purpose**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
   - **Details**: `CITY` is the name of the table in the database. It contains information about cities. The `FROM` keyword tells the database which table to look at for the data.

3. **`WHERE POPULATION > 100000`**:
   - **Purpose**: This filters the rows based on a condition.
   - **Details**: The `WHERE` keyword is used to specify a condition that must be met for the rows to be included in the result. `POPULATION > 100000` is the condition here. It means "only include rows where the value in the `POPULATION` column is greater than 100,000."

4. **`AND COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'`**:
   - **Purpose**: This adds an additional condition that must also be met.
   - **Details**: The `AND` keyword combines multiple conditions. Both conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result. `COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'` means "only include rows where the value in the `COUNTRYCODE` column is 'USA'." The `COUNTRYCODE` is likely a column that contains the code for the country of the city.

### Summary:

The query retrieves all columns from the `CITY` table for rows where the population of the city is greater than 100,000 and the city is located in the United States (as indicated by the `COUNTRYCODE` being 'USA'). 

In simpler terms, this query is asking the database to show all details for cities in the U.S. that have a population larger than 100,000.
