## Introduction
Welcome to the **SQL Problems - HackerRank** repository! This repository contains solutions to various SQL problems found on the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) platform. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data analyst, you'll find these problems and solutions valuable for improving your SQL skills.

## About SQL Programming
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is essential for querying, updating, and managing data within relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL's declarative syntax allows users to specify what data they need rather than how to obtain it.

### Key Features of SQL:
- **Data Retrieval**: SQL allows for powerful querying of data, including complex joins and aggregations.
- **Data Manipulation**: SQL provides commands to insert, update, delete, and manage data.
- **Data Definition**: SQL is used to define and modify database schema structures such as tables and indexes.
- **Data Control**: SQL includes commands for managing permissions and access control to data.
